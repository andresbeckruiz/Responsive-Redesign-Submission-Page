      <h1 class="text-center text-justify">Berkshire Hathaway Website Responsive
        Redesign</h1>
      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4"> Background </h2>
      <p> For this project, I found a poorly designed website and analyzed it's
        issues with respect to memorability, learnability, usability, and
        accessibility. Next, I prototyped a redesign for the website for
        desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts. Finally, I built and deployed the
        redesigned website using HTML and CSS. </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Website Usability Problems</h2>
      <p> I chose to look at the Berkshire Hathaway Website, linked
        <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">here. </a> Below is a
        screenshot of the homepage.
        <img class="img-fluid max-width: 20% mx-auto d-block mt-3 mb-3"
          src="./assets/original-page.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Original
          Website">
        <p> I chose this website because there are glaring issues with the
          accessibility and organization of the homepage. </p>
        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Usability Problems</h4>
        <p> Here are some usability problems with the website I noticed: </p>
        <li> This website has poor memorability because similar information is
          not organized together. For example, content that would fall under the
          “About Us” category (legal, sustainability, corporate governance) is
          scattered. </li>
        <li> The way that information is stored and lack of information on the
          homepage leads to poor usability. For example, you have to click twice
          to see a news report (News Releases -> Link -> PDF). This is
          information that should be accessible on the home page so that users
          can learn about the company when they first visit the webpage. </li>
        <li> There is not enough difference in font size between headers and
          other text, which makes it hard to establish hierarchy. Furthermore,
          some of the text on the webpage is too small, which negatively affects
          accessibility. </li>
        <li> The navigation links to different types of information are included
          in an ordered list of hyperlinks, which negatively affects
          learnability because users have to click on a link to understand that
          it is a top-level link that includes more content.</li>
        <li> There is no search bar or function, which makes it hard to find
          specific information if you are first using the site and not sure
          where it lives. This leads to poor usability and learnability. </li>
        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Accessibility Problems</h4>
        <p> Next, I used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems.
          The main accessibility problem that WAVE found was that the text that
          indicates when a section was updated is too small. I agree that this
          is an issue, as I personally had trouble reading. A related problem
          that WAVE identified was that the headings are stored as an unordered
          list and are not represented as heading elements; this makes the
          website very hard to navigate and negatively affects the
          accessibility. Finally, WAVE pointed out that there is no lang
          attribute value and that none of the page regions have ARIA landmarks;
          these both negatively affect the user experience of anyone trying to
          navigate the page with assistive technology. </p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Visual Redesign</h2>
        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h4>
        <p> During the redesign process, I first created lo-fi wireframes to
          address the usability problems found above. I created wireframes for
          desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.</p>

          Website">

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Visual Design Style Guide</h4>
        <p> Before doing a hi-fi prototype of the redesigned webpage, I defined
          a visual design guide that displays the main colors, typography, and
          reusable components for the redesigned webpage.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid max-width: 20% mx-auto d-block mt-3 mb-3"
          src="./assets/guide.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Original Website">
        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> High-Fidelity Prototyping</h4>

        I next designed high-fidelity prototypes for my redesigned webpage for
        desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Some displays included multiple
        prototypes in order to fully display the interactive functions of my
        webpage, such as the navigation bar.

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Summary of Responses</h4>
        <li> Users chose the self-checkout station because they thought it would
          be quicker than waiting in line for a cashier-checkout station</li>
        <li> One user felt uncomfortable using the self-checkout station because
          they accidentally made a mistake, prompting a CVS employee to check on
          them </li>
        <li> Users generally found scanning each item to be the easiest task and
          placing their items in the correct place to be the hardest</li>
        <li> Users felt nervous about scanning items incorrectly, as there was
          no
          clear way to undo an item scanned by mistake on the display </li>
        <li> Users were confused with the payment process, as the instructions
          on
          the station display did not match the ones given on the card reader
        </li>

              with placing items in the correct area of the self-checkout
              station
              and starting the payment process on the display. This persona
              represents users I observed who were in a hurry and hoping to use
              the self-checkout station so that they could leave the store
              quicker. They also represent users who struggled with misplacing
              items or forgetting to scan items due to their rushed interaction
              with the interface. </p>

              user primarily struggles with figuring out how to undo mistakenly
              scanned items and selecting a payment method. This persona
              represents users I interviewed who were nervous about using the
              self-checkout station due to concerns that they would be flagged
              for
              stealing items, when in reality they were just confused with the
              interface. This persona also represents users who were hesitant to
              use the self-checkout station in case they needed help or made a
              mistake. </p>
